6.1

enum advantage
 - each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data
 - can put any kind of data inside an enum variant 

enum supports impl block

Rust does not have nulls but it has enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent

6.2
matches in Rust are exhaustive
 - must exhaust every last possibility for code to be valid

6.3
if let: less typing, indentation, boilerplate code
 - but lose the exhaustive checking that match enforces
