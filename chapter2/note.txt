To use a type that isn't in the prelude (std::io), 
must bring a type into scope explicity with a 'use' statement

Rust variables are immutable by default
'read_line' returns a 'Result'. It is an enum for states ('Ok' and 'Err')
Err usually an error comeing from underlying operating system
variant: possible states.

Crate: collection of Rust source code files
Binary crate: where a project is being built
Library crate: contains code that is intended to be used in other program. Cant be executed on its own

Cargo only updates the files that is edited during the build 
Cargo lock: prevents from using greater version of anything unless specifically specified
'update' ignores cargo lock and figure out latest version that fit the specification in cargo toml
 - look for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0 since rand crate version is 0.8.
 
To explore other functionality in the any crate, run 'cargo doc --open' and find its section
