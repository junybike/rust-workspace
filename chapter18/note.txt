18.1
While let conditional loop: allow loop to run as long as pattern continues to match

18.2
refutable: can fail to match for some possible value 
if let Some(x) = a_value // not valid. a_value may hold None rather than Some.

irrefutable: pattern that will match for any possible value passed
let x = 5; // x matches anything. cannot fail to match

Function parameters, let statement, for loops only accept irrefutable patterns
