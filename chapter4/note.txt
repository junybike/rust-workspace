4.1
Ownership: enables memory safety gurantees without garbage collector
 - a set of rules that govern how Rust manages memory
 - memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that compiler checks
 - does not compile if any rule is violated
 - no runtime effect 

Rules:
 - each value in Rust has an owner
 - there can be only one owner at a time
 - when owner goes out of scope, value will be dropped

String literals: string value is hardcoded into our program
 - immutable
 - not all string value can be known when we write code.

String: manages data allocated on the heap
 - able to store an amount of text that is unknown to us at compile time 

Memory and allocation for String
 - memory must be requested from memory allocator at runtime (done by calling String::from)
 - need a way to return this memory to allocator when we're done with our String 
 (memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope)

When assigning a completely new value to existing variable, 
Rust calls 'drop' and free original value's memory

Integer types have a known size at compile time are stored entirely on the stack.
 - no difference between deep and shallow copy

Copy trait: variable that use it do not move but trivially copied.
 - still valid after assignment to another variable
 - no copy trait if a type or a any of its parts has drop trait

Types that implement the copy trait
 - all integer, boolean, all floating point, char, tuples (if only contains type that implement copy trait)
